#### **JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS BASICS**

* *Objects* are variable that have a set of data stored in them.

* Some advantages of creating *object literals* are having multiple data in one variable, and being able to add functions as well.

* The difference between *objects* and *arrays* is that *arrays* can be a set of unrelated data. On the other hand, data in an *object* belongs to the *object*.

* An example when to use *bracket notation*, instead of *dot notation*, is when accessing object property is held in a variable (in which a *dot notation* cannot be used to access the value).

* In the referred code, the *this* is a keyword referring to the current object the code is being written inside. The advantage of using it is when assigning an object literal to a new variable, in which case *this* can call an object literal function without having to specifying the new variable.  :shrug:


#### **INTRO TO THE DOM**

* *DOM* is a programming interface for web documents that allows programming languages to interact with the page.

* When "javascript* is created, it uses the *DOM* to access its document and elements.
