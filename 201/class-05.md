## **CODE 201 CLASS 05 READING**

#### **HTML MEDIA**

* A real world use of <alt> attribute in images for website is to provide description read by screen readers.

* Accessibility can be improved in websites by using <alt> rather than <title>, because titles might not be rendered by some browsers and <title> would need a mouse pointer to hover over the image.

* A *figure* element can be useful to identify features in a webpage such as audio, video, or a table.

* The difference between a *gif* and an *svg* is that *gif* is a moving image with defined number of small squares (pixels). *Svg* is a still image and is defined by paths of for the small squares (pixels) the image is made out of.

* When I'd do a screenshot I'd save a *PNG* image, as it's considered lossless.

#### **CCS**

* The *foreground* color in an HTML is applied on the text. The *background* color in an HTML is applied behind the text.

* I'd apply some relatable text and background colors to a website to give it a character. Perhaps, a greenish background for a webpage that talks about plants.

* I'd consider web-safe fonts when applying it an HTML.

* Two ways to add spacing in HTML are *letter-spacing* and *word-spacing.*
