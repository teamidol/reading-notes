**STRUCTURING A WEB FORM**

* *Forms* are so important in web development because it's a very powerful tool for interacting with users.

* When designing a web form with user experience in mind, some keys to consider are using *label* and *legend* elements for screen readers.

* 5 Important Form Elements:

:smiley: *section* Provides a way to organize information data in a webpage.

:smiley: *fieldset* A convenient way to create groups of widgets that share the same purpose, for styling and semantic purposes.

:smiley: *input* Associated with a label. Provides a a specific type of input needed in a webpage.

:smiley: *label* The formal way to define a label for an HTML form widget.

:smiley: *button* Provides a way for the user to interact with the page, such as submitting the form.

#### **JS** 

**INTRODUCTION TO EVENTS**

* *Events* are occurences that happen in a page in which your code can react to. Perhaps, there was something clicked. When that happens your code does something specific based on what's clicked.

* When using an *addEventListener* method it takes two arguments:  the name of the event and a function to handle the event.

* *Event object* automatically pass parameters to event handlers to provide extra features and information. The *target* property in an event object is useful as it always reference to the element the event occured upon.

* The difference between *event bubbling* and *event capture* is that event bubbling starts from the nested element.  Even capture starts from the least nested element.
