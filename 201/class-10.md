#### **TROUBLESHOOTING JAVASCRIPT**

* *Syntax* error are spelling errors in a code that prevents the code from running. *Logic* errors are errors with correct syntax but not rendering the intended result.

* Some error I came across with are syntax errors. Just not knowing where to place parts of a function, or even just the placement of a semicolon.

* In coding, we just comply with what the program is designed to do....type what to render what. Updates could factor in in this ever-evolving practice, and just a normal expectation in the future. 

#### **JAVASCRIPT DEBUGGER**

* *JavaScript Debugger Tool* would show what the loaded JavaScript into the browser renders.

* *Breakpoints* are places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify gthe problems that prevent your code from executing properly.
