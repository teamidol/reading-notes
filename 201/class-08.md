#### **CSS - FLEXBOX**

* Flex being a *one-dimensional* content means that its alignment can be controlled in one axis, i.e. a row or a column.

* The *main axis* is the direction set in the flex-direction property. The *cross axis* is the direction of axis perpendicular to the main axis.

* Some properties of flexbox, such as *row-reverse,* can negatively impact the user experience if the user is using the keyboard arrow keys to navigate the page.

#### **CSS LAYOUT - FLEXBOX**

* Some advantages of *flexbox* over *floats* are when vertically centering a block of content inside its parent, or making all columns in a multple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain different amount of contents.

* This topic connects with the long term goal, when such feature will be needed.
