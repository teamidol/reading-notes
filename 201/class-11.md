#### **VIDEO AND AUDIO CONTENT**

* The ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved from propriety plugin-based technologies since the early 2000's.

* In a video element the "src" attribute provides the source of the video to be rendered. The "controls" attribute provides user control on video playback, such as play/pause and volume control.

* The "fallback content" inside a video element is important as it provides a way to tell the users if their browsers isn't supporting the video playback, and perhaps lead them to the original video as an option.

* One day, Audio told Text-Content, "I'm the boss." Then Video showed Audio that he's the boss. Then Mental-Telepathy made aware to Video that he's the boss. 

#### **A COMPLETE GUIDE TO GRID**

* *Flex* is only one-directional flow, but *grid* has both horizontal and vertical control.

* *Grid container* is teh parent of all grid items. *Grid lines* are the dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. *Grid items" are children of the grid container.

#### **RESPONSIVE IMAGES**

* Developers should make images responsive so that when there's a specific detail in an image that needs to be large enough to be seen, it won't shrink too much in a device with a small screen.

* The "srcset" provides a group of images that the browser can load, depending on it screensize. The right "size" image will then be loaded. 

* To reduce page load times a browser would load images before the main parser starts to load and interpret the page's CSS and JS. The "srcset" can load the right sized image rather than loading both small and large images then having CSS manipulate, or JS pick, the right image for the screensize.
