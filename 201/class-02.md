#### **Intro to HTML**

It's important to use semantic elements in our HTML because search engines, for example, index the page with consideration to the contents of the heading keywords for search rankings.

There are 6 heading levels in HTML.

Element <sup> is used for supercripting a character, and <sub> is used for subscripting a character in an HTML page.

The title attribute is used to provide full expansion of the term used for <abbr>.

#### **Learn CSS**

We can apply CSS in HTML via inline, internal, and external.

Inline styles should be avoided as using other methods could save time when applying the same styles in multiple places.

1.) Selector is "h2"
2.) "color: black" and "padding: 5px" are CSS declarations
3.) "color" and "padding" are properties

#### **Learn JS**

Strings are a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks.

Four types of JavaScript operators are mathematical, assignment, strict equality, and not/does-not-equal.

A real world problem one can solve with a function is interactive experience in webpages.

#### **Making Decisions In Your Code**

An if statment checks a *test* and if it evaluates to *true*, then the code block with execute.

An *else if* condition statement is used to test a new condition if the condition is false in a if statement.

Three types of comparison operators are ===, !, and !==.

"&&" are *logical AND*.  "||" are *logical OR*.
