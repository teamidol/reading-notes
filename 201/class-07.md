#### **DOMAIN MODELING**

* We need *domain modeling* because, in situations, when it's well articulated it can verify and validate the understanding of a problem.

#### **HTML TABLE BASICS**

* Tables should not be used in page layouts as it reduces accessibility to visually impaired users due to tables not being the right tool for layout. Also, working with tables for layout is inefficient for coding as it produces "tag soup."

* There are different kinds of semantic elements for *table*. A "th" tag provides a header for a table. A "td" tag stores data in it.  A "tr" tag can be used to limit "td" tag data row from growing, but rather, start placing subsequent cells on the next row.

#### **CONSTRUCTORS**

* A *constructor* is a function that uses another word. It's advantageous when changing updating multiple objects, so that we don't need to update a specific information in every single object.

* When using "this" in an *object literal,* it's not very useful. It makes it easier to create multiple objects when using "this" in a *constructor.*

#### **OBJECT PROTOTYPES USING CONSTRUCTOR**

* *Prototype* is like the skills I *inherited* from my previous work experience.
