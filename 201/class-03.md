#### **HTML**

* *Unordered list* is used when the list of items' order is meaningless.

* *Bullet style* of unordered list can be changed in the CSS by specifying "circle," "disc," or "square" with the *list-style-type* or *type* attribute.

* *Ordered list* is used when the list of items needs to be in order, as in instruction steps, etc.

* Some ways to change the numbers in ordered list are through CSS *list-style-type* attribute or *type* attribute in the HTML page itself.

#### **CSS**

* In the past, there was only *Padding* in internet explorer. But when *Margin* came, *Padding* was free to expand or held limited within an area.

* In an HTML element box there is a *content box* (where the content is posted), *border box* (the outline around the content), the *padding box* (the space between the content box and the border box), and the *margin* (the space between the border and webpage edge or other contents).

#### **JS**

* *Data types* that can be stored in an array are strings, numbers, objects, and other arrays.

* The *people array* is a valid array. Items can be accessed by using "console.log people[1][2];" in which the "[1]" represents the outer layer of the array and "[2]" represents the inner layer of array.

* Five *shorthand operators*
1. *assignment,* assigns a value to a variable.
2. *addition assignment,* adds to a value, or concatenates.
3. *subtraction assignment,* subtracts from a value
4. *multiplication assignment,* multiplies to a value
5. *division assignment,* divides a variable

* A real world application of when to use a conditional statement in javascript is finding the status of a user to qualify for a benefit. Perhaps, a person over age 65 would be qualified for retirement.

* An example of when a *loop* is useful in JavaScript is, perhaps, needing to render a list of items in a long array.
