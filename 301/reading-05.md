#### **REACT DOCS - THINKING IN REACT**

* *Single responsibility principle* is a technique that follows in having a component ideally only do one thing. And if it grows, it should be decomposed  into smaller subcomponents.

* *Static* version of an app is the version where it renders a data model in which to build on components that reuse other components and pass data using props.  

* Once the static application is built, interactivity can be added using components and props.

* If answer to question is "yes," then it's not a *state.*
1. Does it remain unchanged over time?
2. Is it passed in from a parent via props?
3. Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component?

* To identify where a state needs to live....
1. Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
2. Find their closest common parent componentâ€”a component above them all in the hierarchy.
3. Decide where the state should live...common parent, above parent, or new component above common - parent solely for holding the state.

#### **HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS**

* "Higher-order functions" are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.

* return a boolean if m is greater or less than n.

* A *map* or *reduce* function operates as higher-order functions by producing new results from arrays produced by other functions. Perhaps there's array that's filtered by a filter function. A *map* function can further produce modified contents of the filtered array.
