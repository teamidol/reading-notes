## **301 READING CLASS 09**

#### **FUNCTIONAL PROGAMMING CONCEPTS**

* *Functional programming* is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

* "Pure" function returns the same result if given the same arguments, and it does not cause any observable side effects.

* The benefit of "pure" function is that it's easier to test, not needing to mock anything.

* *Immutability* state cannot change after it's created.

* *Referentially transparent* function consistently yields the same result for the same input.

#### **NODE JS TUTORIAL FOR BEGINNERS #6 - MODULES AND REQUIRE()

* A *module* is a code that has certain functions, as a javascript file.

* *Require()* is a way to provide a function on the global object in app.js.

* We use *require()* to make a module available.

* We have to export the module first, and could have it as a variable.
