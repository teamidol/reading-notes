## **301 READING CLASS **

#### **REACT DOCS - FORMS**

* A *controlled component* is an input form element whose value is controlled by React on subsequent user input.

* I think we can wait to store the user to submit to change the state. That way, it wouldn't render errors while a user is still filling inputs.

* We target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field by adding a *name* attribute.

#### **THE CONDITIONAL (TERNARY) OPERATOR EXPLAINED**

* *Ternary* operator makes it way shorter to code, which can contain only one a line of code.

* x===y ? true : false;
