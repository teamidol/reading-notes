## **301 READING CLASS 08**

#### **API DESIGN BEST PRACTICES**

* REST stands for "representational state transfer."

* REST API's are designed around resources.

* A resource identifier uniquely identifies that resource. Example, an order page.

* The most common HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE.

* URI's can be based on paths in the website.

* A good URI can be "/customers/1/order" then "/orders/99/products."

* A "chatty" API expose a large number of small resources.  This makes the load larger so it's not good.

* A successful GET returns a code 200.

* An unsuccessful GET returns a code 404.

* A successful POST returns a code 201.

* A successful DELETE returns a code 204.
