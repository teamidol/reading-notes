## **301 READING CLASS 02**

#### **REACT LIFECYCLE**

* The *render* happens before the *componentDidMount* based off the diagram.

* The very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React is the constructor.

* The following happens in order: constructor -> render -> React updates -> componentDidMount -> componentWillUnmount.

* The *componentDidMount* is invoked after a component mounts, and loads a network request or initialize the DOM. 

#### **REACT STATE VS PROPS**

* In *props* we can pass things like arguments or counters.

* *Props* are passed from outside into a component, and "state* is handled inside a component.

* We rerender when there is something updated.

* Some examples we can store in a state are counters and information in a form.
