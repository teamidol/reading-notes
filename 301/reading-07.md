## **301 READING CLASS 07**

#### **HOW I EXPLAINED REST TO MY BROTHER**

* Roy Fielding is a smart guy who helped write the first web servers.

* The reason why the technique we used in class won't work when we need to talk to all of the machines in the world is because they weren't design have the requirements to.

* HTTP that Fielding created is a protocol in which it applies verbs to nouns in the internet.

* *Get* requests for a web page to render.

* *Post* adds something to another system.

* *Put* replaces something in another system. 

* *Patch* does a partial update in another system.

#### **API KEYS**

* Weather Bit API... got my API key.

* Yelp API... Not sure yet what parameters the class wants so I haven't requested for one yet.

* The Movie DB API Docs... Not sure yet what parameters the class wants so I haven't requested for one yet.
