## **301 READING CLASS 10**

#### **UNDERSTANDING THE JAVASCRIPT CALL STACK**

* A *call,* at the most basic level, is a data structure that uses Last In - First Out principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation.

* A *call* can happen one at a time.

* LIFO is "last in, first out."

* functionD -> FunctionC ->  [currently used:  FunctionB] -> FunctionA 

* "Stack overflow" occurs when there's a recursive function without an exit point.

#### **JAVASCRIPT ERROR MESSAGES**

* *Reference error* is as simple as trying to use a variable that isn't specifically declared yet. 

* *Syntax error* occurs when there's something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax.

* *Range error* occurs when we try to manipulate an object with some length and giving it an invalid length.

* *Type error* occurs when what we're trying to use or access are incompatible. 

* *Breakpoint* is a certain point where the program halts, when troubleshooting.

* *Debugger* is a statement condition given for a breakpoint.
