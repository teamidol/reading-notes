# **READING NOTES 04**

## **JAVA OO TUTORIAL (ONLY THE OBJECT AND CLASS ONES)**

* An *object* is a software bundle of related state and behavior. A *class* is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created, and it intentionally focus on the basics.

* A couple *states* that a student object may have are "absent" and "present."

* A couple "behaviors* that a student may have are "requesting for TA" or "getting TA attention."

## **JAVA CLASSES (DO NOT DO THE NESTED CLASSES SECTION)**

* Constructor in a class carries over to its subclasses.

* public class dayStudent extends Student {
  boolean requestingForTA, 
  boolean gettingTAAttention
  }

## **BINARY, DECIMAL, AND HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS**

* 1101 binary = 13 decimal

* 52 decimal = 110100 binary = 34 hexadecimal
