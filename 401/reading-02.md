# **READING NOTES 02**

## **JAVA IMPORTS**

* Built-in packages in Java are codes that are default or can be imported into projects. Some built-in packages are the "test" codes included in some templates, or some packages that contains contents that are needed for the SQL query and database connection.

* To create a package in intelliJ, open the project first. Right click on src folder and choose "new package." Enter a package name. Code in it.

## **DIFFERENT TYPES OF LOOPS IN JAVA**

* *For* loops use a loop counter.

* *While* loop repeats a statement while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.  *Do-While" loop has the iniitial condition evaluation happen after the first iteration of the loop.

## **JAVA ARRAYS**

* (Describe 3 built-in methods for Arrays)...(c&p fm https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_arrays.htm)

Sr.No.	Method & Description
1	
public static int binarySearch(Object[] a, Object key)

Searches the specified array of Object ( Byte, Int , double, etc.) for the specified value using the binary search algorithm. The array must be sorted prior to making this call. This returns index of the search key, if it is contained in the list; otherwise, it returns ( â€“ (insertion point + 1)).

2	
public static boolean equals(long[] a, long[] a2)

Returns true if the two specified arrays of longs are equal to one another. Two arrays are considered equal if both arrays contain the same number of elements, and all corresponding pairs of elements in the two arrays are equal. This returns true if the two arrays are equal. Same method could be used by all other primitive data types (Byte, short, Int, etc.)

3	
public static void fill(int[] a, int val)

Assigns the specified int value to each element of the specified array of ints. The same method could be used by all other primitive data types (Byte, short, Int, etc.)

* The size of an array is determined in Java by putting the size in the "[ ]" like.... [10].
