### **Things I Learned**

To code one can use text editors or IDE's (text editor, compiler, debugger in one package).
One should consider themes for eye strain, error highlights, component colors and suggestions for easy coding as choice for a text editor.

Linux sees everything as *files*. 
Files are stored in *directories*.
Directories can be reached by *commands*.

**Some command cheat sheet.**
- cd (change directory)
- ls (list items in current directory)
- cd.. (move back one level from current directory)
