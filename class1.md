### **Stuffs About MARKDOWN.**

**Here are examples about markdown...**

* *Formatting* is not made by what you see. There are special coding to have lists render in the webpage.
* Characters are used to change *font styles*.
* Markdown can be useful in *updating contents* in the webpage. Perhaps, keeping the assigned image space on the webpage.
